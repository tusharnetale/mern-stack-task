## Project Overview

The task involves developing a web application that allows users to browse through a list of products categorized by various parameters. Users should have the capability to sort and filter products based on criteria such as categories, price range, gender, occasion, and discount. Furthermore, the application should empower users to seamlessly edit and delete their selected products, with these modifications being promptly reflected in the user interface.
